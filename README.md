### 🧠 About

Hi there! 👋  
I’m **Malin Fossum**, on my way to becoming a **Full-Stack Engineer** from 🇳🇴 **Norway**.  
My journey started in **social work**, where I learned the importance of empathy, accessibility, and human-centered design.  
Now, I’m blending those values with code to create digital solutions that make a real difference.

This site is my personal space — built from scratch, designed in dark mode, and crafted to grow with my learning journey.  

> “Tech with empathy. Code with purpose.” 🌙
